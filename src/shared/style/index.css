/*
	Layering is ITCSS-like but differs in some important regards:
	* reset - Global resets
	* base - Default styles for elements
	* components - Reusable components
	* variables - CSS variables + variable overrides. This is probably closest to
	  "settings" in traditionaly CSS but when used as a class (rather than a mixin),
	  the intent is closer to it being used like a utility (e.g. a component may
	  define a base font size via a mixin that can be overridden with a class).
	* objects - Layout objects. In traditional ITCSS, these go before components
	  because components should be able to do component-specific layout things.
	  But our objects CSS exports both classes and mixins. Components should
	  generally just use the mixins. If a class is used, that implies it's
	  an override (i.e. being used like a utility).
	* tools - Utility classes. These are used to override other styles. Traditional
	  ITCSS differentiates between "tools" (lowest precedence) and "utilities" (highest),
	  but we just stick them together with the understanding that mixins have lowest
	  precedence (they don't get emitted) and classes with the same name have highest.
