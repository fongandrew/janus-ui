Look at how we handle the border-radius variable in .c-details (where we use a --v-radius variable). I want to extend that so it fits the pattern more generally. Look at how --v-spacing works for instance. Consider what tool mixins need to be updated. The end goal is to be able to set `--v-radius` on any one component and have it override how the default radius tools work in certain components.
